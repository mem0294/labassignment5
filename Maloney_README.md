# Reflection Question
*Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study*.

As of right now, I don't really have a good way of keeping up with my codes (which feels pretty terrible now that I think about it). I really like GitHub and think it is a good resource, but also requires a learning curve. My current code would not stand up to a reproduceability test, unfortunetly, but this and the capstone exercise were enlightening about the process.

I think one thing I would comment on in general is when people upload their codes, if you are a novice it is really difficult to understand what the codes mean and how to approach learning about them. I think in the future I would annotate my codes so that it was readable for ANYONE, not just a computational biologists. I have not had the pleasure of working on anything big in my own field, but as I transition to more big data information I think I will have more information.
